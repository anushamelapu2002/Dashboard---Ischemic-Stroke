# Ischemic Stroke – Outcome & Performance Dashboard
## Project Objective
To evaluate and monitor ischemic stroke outcomes by analyzing **30-day mortality** and **30-day readmission** rates, enabling stakeholders to:
- Identify trends over time
- Compare hospital performance
- Support data-driven decision-making for improving healthcare quality
## Dataset Collected From
- Publicly available healthcare performance datasets containing **risk-adjusted rates** for ischemic stroke outcomes
- Data categorized by **year**, **country/county**, and **hospital**
- Covers multiple reporting periods (**2011–2015**)
- Dataset Used:
- <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/ischemic-stroke-30-day-mortality-and-30-day-readmission-rates-and-quality-ratings-for-ca-h-92036"
## Key Questions / KPIs
1. What is the **average 30-day mortality rate** for ischemic stroke patients?
2. What is the **average 30-day readmission rate**?
3. How do mortality and readmission rates **vary by year**?
4. Which hospitals have the **lowest** and **highest** mortality rates?
5. How do outcomes differ **across countries/counties**?
6. What is the **performance gap** between the top 10 and bottom 10 hospitals?
## Process
### 1. Data Collection
- Gathered ischemic stroke outcome data from official healthcare sources.
### 2. Data Cleaning
- Removed special characters and formatting errors
- Standardized hospital and location names
- Ensured consistent date formats and measure naming
### 3. Data Transformation
- Created calculated fields (e.g., average risk-adjusted rates)
- Classified hospitals into **top** and **bottom** performers based on mortality rates
### 4. Data Analysis
- Built pivot tables for KPI summaries
- Conducted trend analysis over multiple years
- Performed comparative analysis by geography and hospital ranking
### 5. Dashboard Design
- Developed a clean, interactive layout
- Added slicers for dynamic filtering by year, measure, and geography
- Created visualizations for:
  - Top/Bottom hospitals
  - Yearly trends
  - Location-based performance
- Dashboard Interaction <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/:x:/g/personal/DDC6ECB7BBD81A2A/EcL8HhKq0DxJl7JyuJl3P74BPjy--TsURuqDCfxXz87QDw?resid=DDC6ECB7BBD81A2A!s121efcc2d0aa493c97b272b899773fbe&ithint=file%2Cxlsx&e=nUBqOJ&migratedtospo=true&redeem=aHR0cHM6Ly8xZHJ2Lm1zL3gvYy9kZGM2ZWNiN2JiZDgxYTJhL0VjTDhIaEtxMER4Smw3Snl1SmwzUDc0QlBqeS0tVHNVUnVxRENmeFh6ODdRRHc_ZT1uVUJxT0o"

## Insights
- **Average 30-day mortality rate:** ~10.22%
- **Average 30-day readmission rate:** ~12.10%
- Top-performing hospitals have risk-adjusted rates significantly lower than bottom-performing hospitals.
- Year-over-year variations highlight areas for quality improvement.
